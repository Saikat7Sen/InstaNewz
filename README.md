This is a simple news summary app that uses a News API to fetch news articles and a Large Language Model (LLM) to summarize articles.
The app uses `Kokoro Text-to-speech` model from `HuggingFace` to convert news articles into speech for the user to listen to. It supports multiple languages and can be configured to read the summaries in the user's preferred language.

## Features
